# 2d game math in 100 pictures

A series of short explainers of various 2d gamedev math concepts, explained with
images.

## Why

I've tried my hand at 2d game dev "from scratch" (i.e. no frameworks) recently,
building games such as [safe tea] and [down the river]. Along the way, I
had to figure out how to do the math for a lot of 2d concepts / gamedev
concepts. I [diagram a lot] to try and understand what I'm doing. This is my
attempt at organizing and sharing the lessons I've learned.
